  "description": "My father has asked me this question before over the years. So has an experienced developer recently. Seeing the same question from two such different perspectives got me asking it of myself. While a new data storage system can always be added to git-annex, or a new command be added to improve some use case, both of those can also be accomplished without needing changes to git-annex, by external remotes and more targeted frontends such as DataLad. So what then is the potential surface area of problem space that git-annex may expand to cover? Do diminishing returns and complexity make such expansions a good idea? I will explore this by considering recent developments in git-annex, and the impact of lesser-used features.\n\nPart of Distribits 2024: https://distribits.live",
